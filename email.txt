Travis,
Don't think you can get away with what you've done. funger@seas.upenn.edu is after you, and there's nothing sweirich@cis.upenn.edu can do about it. hongboz@seas.upenn.edu has given his approval. You're done for. I hope you reflect on your misdeeds when gaboardi@cs.unibo.it visits you in prison. By the way, iamnotanemail@notemail shouldn't be matched by the given file. Oh, and don't think @thisisntanemail will be matched, either.

Sincerely,
jinesh.desai@outlook.com
